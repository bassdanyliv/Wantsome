    <p> <u>"Lucky Per" - Henrik Pontopidan</u><br>
        This is <b><i>the finest</i></b> book I have read in a very long time.
        An exceptionally <b><i>well written</i></b> book, by an extremely <b><i>empathetic, razor sharp</i></b> 
        and<b><i></i>witty</i></b> writer. <br>
        We have still to tackle many of the problems in our society and in ourselves that Per personifies.
        Highly recommended!</p>

    <h1>All humans will not have the same future: Yuval Noah Harari</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Rise of machines</b> <br>

        All humans will not have the same future. Some countries will become extremely wealthy because of AI. The main
        thing about AI is inequality. It will have a different impact on different classes and different countries.

        While countries like the US and China will benefit tremendously from AI, others might completely collapse in the
        future. Just think about Bangladesh, a nation with a huge textile industry. In the years ahead, it will be
        cheaper to produce a shirt in New York rather than Dhaka. Bangladeshis would need new jobs.

        However, I don’t think AI would completely destroy all jobs. Some jobs will disappear, while other new jobs
        would be created. The next question is whether you have the education to fill the new jobs? There may be no need
        for textile workers but you do need more software engineers. However, it isn’t easy to take a 40-year-old
        unemployed textile worker in Bangladesh and turn her overnight into a software engineer.

        So, these are the two issues. Both in terms of class and in terms of country, there will be winners and losers
        and unless we take action to create a global safety net, some countries could completely collapse and shock
        waves of immigrants will impact the whole world.

        Therefore, we need a global collaboration. We need to also think: how do we help the countries which are left
        behind in the AI race? How do you help them not to be completely bankrupt by the automation revolution?</p><br>
